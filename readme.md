## Description ##

Playing on multiple multiplayer servers brings challanges that should have easy solution.

* different mod versions
* passwords for multiplayer servers

Best solution for mods is to use separate folders for each multiplayer and put all related mods to one folder. This is also good practice for single player games because it seems that multiple maps in one folder can cause many issues.

Farming Simulator 19 stores only last password used for conneting to multiplayer server. You don't see the password in game so unless you remember which server was last one, you have to re-enter password everytime.

## Solution ##

FS19_PredSet is Windows application which allows you to predefine up to 7 different settings that can later be applied with one click. You can also see what are current settings and start Steam version of FS19 directly from the app.

### You can predefine ###

* Mod folder
* Username for multiplayer games
* Server name used in search
* Server password
